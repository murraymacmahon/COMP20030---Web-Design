# webdesign
This project was completed in my 1st year of studying Computer Science in UCD.
The aim was to create a website that celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising. I chose to include information
about the Rising, events taking place in 2016 and and gallery. This is my first ever website.
