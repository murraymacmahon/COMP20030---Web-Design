  The GPO on O'Connell street will be opening a Witness History exhibition where you will be taken back in time to Dublin 100 years ago.

<p>
  The Easter Sunday Parade is on Sunday the 27th of March and will begin at 10am at St.Stephen's Green. The parade
  will pass by RCSI, up Patrick's St., past Dublin Castle, across O'Connell Bridge at about 12:30pm, up O'Connell St
  and ending at Bolton St at about 3pm. With large crowds expected to attend, 22 Big Screen feeds have been provided,
  including live commentary so no matter where you are spectating you won't miss a thing.

  Kilmainham Gaol will be host to many events over the course of the commemorations this year but there will be no better place to see the best re-enactments of scenes of the Rising than here. Be sure to check out <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.ie">ticket availability</a> soon!
