  <h3 align="left">What was the Easter Rising?</h3>
  <p>The Easter Rising also known as the Easter Rebellion, was an armed insurrection in Ireland
    during Easter Week, April 1916. The Rising was launched by Irish republicans to end British rule in Ireland and establish
    an independent Irish Republic while the United Kingdom was heavily engaged in World War I. It was the most significant
    uprising in Ireland since the rebellion of 1798, and the first armed action of the Irish revolutionary period.

  <h3 align="left">Did you know?</h3>
  <p>In 1916, one of the most important events in Irish history happened when the GPO became the headquarters for the Easter Rising. At that time, Ireland
     and Britain were a United Kingdom but many Irish people wanted Ireland to be in control of its own affairs and a
     few were prepared to fight for Irish independence.

    11.00: About 1,000 members of the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army gather across Dublin.

    Volunteers seize weapons from the Magazine Fort in Dublin’s Phoenix Park.

    Rebels march into the GPO, and establish the headquarters of the Rising. The tricolour is flown from the roof.

    Paidraig Pearse reads out a proclamation declaring Ireland a Republic on behalf of the ‘Provisional Government’.

    British lancers are ambushed at the Four Courts. The British cavalry charges down O’Connell Street towards the GPO but are driven back.
