  The image on the left is an impression of the GPO in 1916 and on the right is a modern-day photo. A lot has changed since then. The rebel HQ was reduced to a shell in the Rising and reopened only in 1929.The scene today is a lot more tranquil. The scene today is a lot more tranquil.

  The Irish Defence forces had membership of about 180,000 at the time of the Rising. On Easter Monday the Volunteers occupied a number of strategic buildings
  that commanded the main routes into the capital. The fighting became more and more intense over time with violent street battles taking place. On
  the Saturday the insurgent leaders, based mainly in the General Post Office, were
  forced to agree to a surrender. Their decision was then made known to and accepted, sometimes reluctantly, by the
  Garrisons still fighting. The Garrison were able to hold out against several British attacks and when the GPO was evacuated the intention was to move the entire Rebel Headquarters there. It was only when Pearse witnessed civilians being gunned down by British forces in the Moore St area that he decided to abandon this and surrender, in order to prevent further loss of life.

  The city of Dublin has changed a lot in the last 100 years - from the destruction of the Rising when the British bomber ship sailed up the Liffey causing huge damage to the city - to the many
  modern developments that are on an ongoing basis in the city almost daily. The capital has seen many changes in it's dramatic lifetime.

    This old photo shows members of Cumman na mBan marching down Parnell Square in the time leading up to the rising. The modern day Garden of Remembrance commemorating the Rising & the War of Independence is further up on the left in the new photo.
