      Michael Collins 16 October 1890 – 22 August 1922) was a soldier
      and politician who was a leading figure in the struggle for Irish independence in the early 1900s.<br />
      Collins was an Irish revolutionary leader, prominent politician and eventual President of the Irish Republican<br />
      Brotherhood from November 1920 until his death. He was a member of the Irish delegation during the<br />
      Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations. Subsequently, he was both Chairman of the Provisional Government and<br />
      Commander-in-chief of the National Army. Collins was shot and killed in an ambush in August 1922 in Cork during the Irish Civil War.</p>

      Patrick Henry Pearse,  10 November 1879 – 3 May 1916, was an Irish teacher, barrister, poet, writer, nationalist and
      political activist who was one of the leaders of the Easter Rising in 1916. Following his execution along with fifteen
      other leaders, Pearse came to be seen by many as the embodiment of the rebellion. He was the leader who read out
      the Proclamation at the GPO and this link will show you a copy of that <a href="http://www.easter1916.net/proclamation.htm">script.</a>

    <h2 align="center">Women involved in the Rising</h2>
    <p>
      Countess Markievicz was undoubtedly the female lead of the Easter Rising.
      A charismatic revolutionary, politician, suffragette and socialist, she had a remarkable life before and after 1916.
      While other nations were still fighting to secure voting rights for women, Markievicz had become one of the first women in the world to hold a cabinet position, as Minister for Labour in the Irish Republic from 1919-1922.
      The Proclamation of Independence itself, read out on the steps of the GPO, was a radical endorsement of equal rights for women in Irish society.

      In December 1918, she was the first woman elected to the British House of Commons, though she did not take her seat and, along with the other Sinn Féin TDs, formed the first Dáil Éireann. She was also one of the first women in the world to hold a cabinet position, as Minister for Labour of the Irish Republic.
      In the Rising, Markievicz fought in St Stephen's Green, where on the first morning—according to one account—she shot a member of the (unarmed) Dublin Metropolitan Police, who subsequently died of his injuries. Other accounts place her at City Hall when the policeman was shot, only arriving at Stephen's Green later. Markievicz supervised the setting-up of barricades on Easter Monday and was in the middle of the fighting all around Stephen's Green, wounding a British army sniper.
